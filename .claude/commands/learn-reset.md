description: Reset your learning progress to start fresh
---

Ask the user to confirm they want to reset their learning progress. This will delete the .learn-progress.json file and they'll start from Module 1 again.

If they confirm, delete the .learn-progress.json file and tell them their progress has been reset. They can start fresh by invoking the learn-claude-code skill.

If they don't confirm, do nothing.
