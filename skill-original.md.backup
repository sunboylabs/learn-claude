# Module 1: First Steps

## What You'll Learn
- How to communicate with Claude Code effectively
- Basic commands you can use
- How to ask questions about your codebase
- Understanding tool usage (Read, Glob, Grep basics)

## Core Concepts

Claude Code is an AI assistant that lives in your terminal and can:
- **Read and analyze** any file in your project
- **Search and explore** codebases of any size
- **Write and edit** code with surgical precision
- **Execute commands** via bash
- **Manage complex tasks** with built-in project management
- **Access the web** to fetch docs and search for information

### Communication Style
- Be direct and specific with requests
- Claude can see your entire project but needs you to guide focus
- You can run multiple operations in parallel
- Tool results show you exactly what Claude is doing

### Basic Interaction Patterns

**Good requests:**
- "Read the main.py file and explain what it does"
- "Find all TypeScript files that import React"
- "Create a new function to validate email addresses"

**Even better requests:**
- "Search for all TODO comments in Python files and create a task list"
- "Read app.py and tests/test_app.py, then add tests for the missing edge cases"
- "Find where the authentication logic is implemented and explain the flow"

## Hands-On Exercise 1.1

Let's start simple. I want you to practice giving me a clear request:

**Task**: Ask me to find and read a specific file in your current project, then explain what it does.

Try it now! Give me a command like: "Find the [file type] file that handles [functionality] and explain it to me"

---

*[WAIT FOR USER TO COMPLETE EXERCISE 1.1 BEFORE CONTINUING]*

---

## Exercise 1.2: Using Glob

Now let's practice file searching.

**What is Glob?** It's a tool for finding files by pattern:
- `**/*.py` - All Python files in any directory
- `src/**/*.ts` - All TypeScript files under src/
- `*.json` - JSON files in current directory

**Task**: Ask me to find all files of a specific type in your project. Use a pattern like "Find all [file extension] files" or "Show me all test files".

Try it now!

---

*[WAIT FOR USER TO COMPLETE EXERCISE 1.2]*

---

## Exercise 1.3: Basic Code Understanding

**Task**: Now ask me to explain how a specific feature or function works in your codebase. Be specific about what you want to understand.

Example: "Explain how user authentication works" or "Show me how the database connection is configured"

- **Write** - Creating new files
- **Edit** - Making surgical changes to existing files
- **Grep** - Content-based searching (finding code patterns)
- **Glob** - Advanced pattern matching

## The File Operation Tools

### Read Tool
- Reads entire files or specific line ranges
- Can read multiple files in parallel
- Shows line numbers for easy reference

**Examples:**
- "Read package.json"
- "Read lines 50-100 of server.js"
- "Read both the component and its test file"

### Write Tool
- Creates new files from scratch
- MUST read existing file first before overwriting
- Use for NEW files only

**Examples:**
- "Create a new utils/validator.js file with email validation"
- "Write a README.md explaining the project"

### Edit Tool
- Makes precise changes using string replacement
- Preserves everything else in the file
- Can replace all occurrences or just first match
- Must provide exact old string to replace

**Examples:**
- "Change the port from 3000 to 8080"
- "Rename the function getUserData to fetchUserData"
- "Update the error message in the login function"

### Grep Tool
- Searches file CONTENTS (not just filenames)
- Uses regex patterns
- Can filter by file type
- Shows context lines around matches

**Examples:**
- "Find all TODO comments in the codebase"
- "Search for console.log statements in JavaScript files"
- "Find where the API_KEY constant is used"

## Hands-On Exercise 2.1: Read Multiple Files

**Task**: Ask me to read 2-3 related files in parallel (like a component and its test, or a config file and its usage).

Try it: "Read [file1] and [file2] together"

---

# Module 8: Power User Mastery

## What You'll Learn
- **Best practices** - Pro patterns and techniques
- **Performance optimization** - Speed up workflows
- **Common pitfalls** - What to avoid
- **Real-world scenarios** - Complex problem-solving
- **Troubleshooting** - Debugging Claude interactions

## Power User Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific and Direct
❌ "Can you help with the code?"
✓ "Refactor the getUserData function in api/users.js to use async/await and add error handling"

### 2. Use Parallel Operations
❌ Sequential: "Read file1" → wait → "Read file2" → wait
✓ Parallel: "Read file1 and file2 together"

### 3. Leverage Sub-Agents for Exploration
❌ "Search for 'auth' in Python files" → "Search for 'login'" → "Search for 'token'"
✓ "How does authentication work across the codebase?" (uses Explore agent)

### 4. Let Claude Manage Complex Tasks
❌ Breaking down steps yourself and asking one at a time
✓ "Implement user authentication with JWT, refresh tokens, and middleware"
(Claude uses TodoWrite to plan and execute)

### 5. Use the Right Tool for the Job
- **Grep** - Search file contents
- **Glob** - Find files by name pattern
- **Read** - Read specific files
- **Edit** - Modify existing files (not sed/awk)
- **Write** - Create new files (not echo)
- **Bash** - Terminal commands (not file operations)

### 6. Context Management
- Reference specific files: "In src/app.js:45"
- Point to line numbers when discussing code
- Use file paths consistently

### 7. Git Workflow Excellence
- Let Claude create meaningful commit messages
- Review diffs before committing
- Use descriptive branch names
- Create comprehensive PRs

## Performance Optimization

### Speed Up Complex Tasks
1. **Parallel reads**: Read multiple files simultaneously
2. **Specific patterns**: Use precise glob/grep patterns
3. **Sub-agents**: Let specialized agents handle complex exploration
4. **Focused requests**: Tell Claude exactly what you need

### Reduce Context Usage
1. **Avoid reading huge files** unnecessarily
2. **Use line ranges** for large files: "Read lines 100-200"
3. **Targeted searches** instead of broad sweeps
4. **Let agents explore** instead of loading everything into context

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This:
1. **Asking vague questions** - "Fix the bug"
2. **Reading files manually then pasting** - Claude can read them
3. **Making Claude use echo/cat for files** - Use Read/Write/Edit
4. **Forgetting to commit work** - Secure your progress
5. **Skipping git diffs** - Always review changes
6. **Not using todos for complex tasks** - You'll lose track
7. **Fighting with Claude** - If confused, clarify the request

### ✓ Do This Instead:
1. **Be specific** - "Fix the TypeError in line 45 of auth.js"
2. **Direct file access** - "Read src/config.json"
3. **Use proper tools** - Edit tool for file modifications
4. **Regular commits** - "Commit these changes with a message about..."
5. **Review first** - "Show me the diff of my changes"
6. **Trust the system** - Claude manages complex tasks well
7. **Iterate** - Refine requests based on results

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Refactoring a Feature
```
"I need to refactor the user authentication system to:
1. Use async/await instead of callbacks
2. Add input validation
3. Improve error handling
4. Add unit tests
Please analyze the current implementation and create a plan."
```

Claude will:
- Create todos for each step
- Read relevant files
- Propose refactoring approach
- Implement changes incrementally
- Run tests

### Scenario 2: Debugging Production Issue
```
"Users are reporting intermittent 500 errors.
Search the codebase for:
- Error handling in API routes
- Database connection issues
- Timeout configurations
Help me identify potential causes."
```

Claude will:
- Use Explore agent to search comprehensively
- Read relevant error handling code
- Analyze configurations
- Propose fixes

### Scenario 3: Adding a New Feature
```
"Add a password reset feature with:
- Email token generation
- Expiring reset links
- Secure password update
- Email notifications
Follow our existing auth patterns."
```

Claude will:
- Explore existing auth implementation
- Plan the feature with todos
- Implement incrementally
- Add tests
- Create a PR

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Claude seems confused?
- **Clarify your request** - Be more specific
- **Provide context** - Point to specific files
- **Break it down** - Split complex requests

### Tools not working as expected?
- **Check file paths** - Must be absolute
- **Verify permissions** - Can Claude access the files?
- **Review output** - Read error messages carefully

### Git operations failing?
- **Check repository status** - Is it a git repo?
- **Review branches** - Are you on the right branch?
- **Verify credentials** - Can you push to remote?

### Performance is slow?
- **Use parallel operations** - Multiple tools at once
- **Leverage sub-agents** - Let them handle exploration
- **Be specific** - Avoid unnecessary searching

## Hands-On Exercise 8.1: Complex Real-World Task

**Final Challenge**: Give me a complex, real-world task that requires multiple tools and steps.

This should be something you actually need done in your project. Examples:
